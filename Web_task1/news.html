                        Real Madrid tonight face the first away outing of the Champions League campaign at
                         Borussia-Park (9pm CET), where they take on Borussia Mönchengladbach on Matchday 2 
                         of the group stage. Zinedine Zidane's players will be looking to get the better of 
                         opponents that hold fond memories for madridista followers.
                        Juanito's jumps of joy are the most memorable image of the iconic meeting between the two 
                        sides after he played his part in completing one of Real Madrid's most stunning European 
                        comebacks. Thirty-five years on from that match, the madridistas renew acquaintances with
                         the German outfit and will be bidding to reproduce the performance that secured victory 
                         in El Clásico.

                    <p class="news-item_content">
                        Before taking to the Borussia-Park pitch for the team's training session, Toni 
                        Kroos addressed the media in a press conference in which he preview the side's 
                        second Champions League outing of the campaign: "We're aware of the significance 
                        of the game. After the defeat in our first match, against Shakhtar Donetsk, the 
                        pressure is on us to win, but I have faith in us. It's like a cup final for us".
                        "I don't think that Zinedine Zidane has ever had any question marks about us. We 
                        all win and lose together. It's not a case of us not backing him when we lose. 
                        That'd be the easy thing to do, if things go badly, for us to speak badly of others. 
                        We're not like that and you saw that on Saturday".
                        Return to Germany
                        "I always enjoy coming back to Germany because it's my country, 
                        my language and everything's more straightforward for me. But I've 
                        always said that I enjoy myself at Madrid and like living in Madrid. Over the course 
                        of six years, you always receive offers, but I feel really at home in Madrid and my idea 
                        is to end my career here".
